        We created Pull Games to make sure everyone can have affordable prices, to be able to play in the online gaming world.  We know most people can’t afford the very expensive things at a normal store, so we created this.  Bennett Hanson and I, Nolan Cain, also have a passion for gaming, so we felt like this would be a great idea. We founded it in 2008, when Ben first started the company, but 1 year later he felt like he needed a business partner, and decided to add me, because I was up to the task.  So here we are today, with Pull Games, and we are still following our motto, “We Don’t Shame, We Game”. <br />
